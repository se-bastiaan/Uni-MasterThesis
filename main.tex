Anomaly detection using linear inpainting transformers\\

\section{Problem statement}
\label{problem-statement}

For this project we will focus on the task of anomaly detection using image inpainting. Anomaly detection is the task of detecting faults in a set of given images. 
This task is usually performed using convolutional autoencoders\cite{Autoencoder-Detection:2021} or generative models\cite{GAN-Detection:2021}.

In recent work the usage of transformers was introduced for computer vision tasks\cite{VisualTransformers:2020}. Transformers have also been used to explore anomaly detection\cite{Inpainting:2021}.

Katharopoulos et al introduced linear transformers\cite{LinearTransformers:2020} to improve the computational and memory costs. For our research we would like to explore using this type of transformers for anomaly detection.

\section{Approach}

We will start out project by trying to reproduce both the work into linear transformers and anomaly detection using inpainting mentioned in the previous section.
This will hopefully give us a solid starting point to try using the linear transformers for the task of anomaly detection.

\section{Related work}

Previous work related to anomaly detection can be found using different approaches, like mentioned in the first section. But anomaly detection itself is also a diverse subject.

In 2018 Loganathan et al.\cite{Anomaly-LSTM:2018} presented their research using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). They applied this type of model on network packets to detect network intrusions.

In earlier work Erfani et al.\cite{Anomaly-SVM:2016} used a type of support vector machines to make similar anomaly detections on IoT networks.

Like mentioned in the problem statement, another option is using autoencoders. Like Tsai et al.\cite{Autoencoder-Detection:2021} did to look for surface defects.

Using generative adversarial networks (GAN) which was explored by both Zenati et al.\cite{Anomaly-GAN:2019} and Ngo et al.\cite{GAN2:2019} by looking at performance on the MNIST and KDD99 datasets.

Inpainting for anomaly detection has been explored already by Pirnay et al.\cite{Inpainting:2021} using transformers and Nguyen et al.\cite{adversarial-inpainting:2021} using convolutional neural networks.

Inpainting has also been used in different contexts. Xie et al.\cite{inpainting-dnn:2012} utilised autoencoders and Yeh et al.\cite{inpainting-generative:2017} used GANs for this task, focusing on reconstructing images of faces.
