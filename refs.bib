abstract = {In this paper, the unsupervised autoencoder learning for automated defect detection in manufacturing is evaluated, where only the defect-free samples are required for the model training. The loss function of a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) model only aims at minimizing the reconstruction errors, and makes the representative features widely spread. The proposed CAE in this study incorporates a regularization that improves the feature distribution of defect-free samples within a tight range. It makes the representative feature vectors of all training samples as close as possible to the mean feature vector so that a defect sample in the evaluation stage can generate a distinct distance from the trained center of defect-free samples. The proposed CAE model with regularizations has been tested on a variety of material surfaces, including textural and patterned surfaces in images. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CAE with regularizations significantly outperforms the conventional CAE for defect detection applications in the industry.}

abstract = {High-dimensional problem domains pose significant challenges for anomaly detection. The presence of irrelevant features can conceal the presence of anomalies. This problem, known as the ‘curse of dimensionality’, is an obstacle for many anomaly detection techniques. Building a robust anomaly detection model for use in high-dimensional spaces requires the combination of an unsupervised feature extractor and an anomaly detector. While one-class support vector machines are effective at producing decision surfaces from well-behaved feature vectors, they can be inefficient at modelling the variation in large, high-dimensional datasets. Architectures such as deep belief networks (DBNs) are a promising technique for learning robust features. We present a hybrid model where an unsupervised DBN is trained to extract generic underlying features, and a one-class SVM is trained from the features learned by the DBN. Since a linear kernel can be substituted for nonlinear ones in our hybrid model without loss of accuracy, our model is scalable and computationally efficient. The experimental results show that our proposed model yields comparable anomaly detection performance with a deep autoencoder, while reducing its training and testing time by a factor of 3 and 1000, respectively.}
